### :books: Modelos Determinísticos de Investigação Operacional
***
These projects consisted in resolving several problems using fundamental principles of operation research.

- The first project consisted in solving a problem where we needed to determine the shortest path for a drone to travel by using the concept of eulerian graph and circuit.  
  - First Project: 20

- The second project consisted in solving a problem where we needed to carefully remove blocks from a mine by using the concept of maximum-weight or minimum-weight closure in a graph.  
  - Seconde Project: 15

- The third and last project consisted in planning the execution of a project through reducing the time of some activities by using the concept of mixed-integer programming and Gantt diagram. 
  - Third Project: 20
